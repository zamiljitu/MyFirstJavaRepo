# MyFirstJavaRepo

This java project is created in NetBeans IDE 8.0.2 and java version 7 update 51. This is my first attempt to create a repository in GitHub. In future I have plan to add small examples for all the java features to make this project a quick reference a java feature. This java project and repository is created for learning purpose and open for all to download and/or fork at your own risk. Wish you a very good journey in Java and GitHub. Happy Coding!
